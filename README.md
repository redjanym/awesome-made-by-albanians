## But why?

A lot of developers in Albania do not know about these projects and the fact that their authors are also Albanian programmers. It warms your heart when you understand that a lot of projects are made by Albanian developers.

## Contributing 

It's hard to calculate project popularity so we use stars and proven usability statistics(installation stats) as a measurement and we categorise them by their primary programming language. It's not quite fair, but it is what we have until we create a more rich list and a more structured listing will be needed.

If you want to add project to this list, please, make sure that:

1. The project was created by the developer born in Albania or self-indicate themself as Albanians.
2. The project has a precise function(so demo and weekend projects are not accepted, we all have made a demo blog app)
3. Please provide in some way the usability of your project(installation stats, like npm, composer or some other way)

If they do, feel free to make a PR!

(Please, check twice that you have picked the correct category and added the project according to alphabetical order.)
